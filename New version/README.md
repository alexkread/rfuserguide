Few notes during the conversion from reStructuredText to markdown:

### Throughout
- Styling of top-level headings, **"TEXT IN UPPERCASE"** to match certifications guide
-  Styling of child-level headings, **"Text with 1 initial capital letter"** to match certifications guide

- Deprecations: Suggest to remove bits like this:
>&#9888; _Robot Framework also supports singular headers such as  `*** Setting ***,` but that support was deprecated in Robot Framework 6.0. There is a visible deprecation warning starting from Robot Framework 7.0 and singular headers will eventually not be supported at all._

### "Create input data" 
- renamed without "create" as it's likely create, scope, re-assign and use of input data
- "Input data" (useable for RPA also)
